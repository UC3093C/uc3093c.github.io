# Exam 2

Knowledge checks are designed to test your understanding of the concepts and tools discussed in the course.

Answers are not provided for the knowledge checks as they are intended to be a learning tool. Each knowledge check clearly indicates which reading assignment the questions are based on.

```{note}
The exam questions will test the same concepts but **may** be presented in different formats than those appearing in the knowledge checks. Use these knowledge checks to ensure you understand the underlying principles rather than memorizing specific answers.
