# Lab 2: Automation

**Software Engineering as a Layered Technology**, developed by IEEE, illustrates how different aspects of software engineering build upon one another to form a cohesive framework.

The **tools layer** plays a vital role by providing the semi-automated and automated tools that support software engineering projects. Automation tools represent a key part of this layer, enabling systematic execution of repetitive tasks and ensuring consistent software quality across development cycles.

**GitHub Actions**, as a powerful automation and continuous integration service within GitHub, enables developers to automate workflows, run tests, and streamline deployment processes. Through this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with essential automation workflows, commonly used in professional software development environments.

## Task 

You will complete the following interactive courses provided by the GitHub Team through GitHub Classroom.

|   | **Task**                     | **Invitation**                                | **Points** |

|  1| Introduction to GitHub       | [Invitation 1](https://classroom.github.com/a/3KHF85l1) | 10         |
|  2| Communicate Using Markdown   | [Invitation 2](https://classroom.github.com/a/qCGXcgl_) | 10         |
|  3| Review Pull Request          | [Invitation 3](https://classroom.github.com/a/sOr-0yOA) | 20         |

## Grading

For each task, full points will be awarded only for complete tasks. Zero points will be given for partial completion or no attempt.

## Submission

After completing all tasks, you must submit the URLs for the GitHub repositories containing your completed work. Submit these URLs through the **Canvas Assignment** provided for this lab.
