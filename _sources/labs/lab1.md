# Lab 1: Version Control Systems

**Software Engineering as a Layered Technology**, developed by IEEE, illustrates how different aspects of software engineering build upon one another to form a cohesive framework.

The **tools layer** plays a vital role by providing the semi-automated and automated tools that support software engineering projects. Version control systems are a key part of this layer, enabling systematic management of software artifacts and fostering collaborative development practices.

**GitHub**, as one of the leading platforms for version control, offers a powerful environment for tracking changes, managing code versions, and facilitating teamwork. Through this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with essential GitHub workflows, commonly used in professional software development environments.


## Task 

You will complete the following interactive courses provided by the GitHub Team through GitHub Classroom.
