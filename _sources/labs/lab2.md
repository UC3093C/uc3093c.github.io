# Lab 2: Automation

**Software Engineering as a Layered Technology**, developed by IEEE, illustrates how different aspects of software engineering build upon one another to form a cohesive framework.

The **tools layer** plays a vital role by providing the semi-automated and automated tools that support software engineering projects. Automation tools represent a key part of this layer, enabling systematic execution of repetitive tasks and ensuring consistent software quality across development cycles.

```{important}
Engineering labor costs typically represent 60-80% of total software project expenses, dwarfing infrastructure, tooling, and operational costs. This means that even modest improvements in developer productivity through automation can drive significant ROI.
```

**GitHub Actions**, as a powerful automation and continuous integration service within GitHub, enables developers to automate workflows, run tests, and streamline deployment processes. Through this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with essential automation workflows, commonly used in professional software development environments.

## Task 

You will complete the following interactive courses provided by the GitHub Team through GitHub Classroom.  

```{note}
The first task in Lab 2 does not use GitHub Actions, it is a continuation of your understanding of GitHub and common GitHub workflows (which was the focus of Lab 1).
```

|  1| Release-based Worfklow | [Invitation 1](https://classroom.github.com/a/cu9aB0zp) | 25         |
|  2| Hello GitHub Actions   | [Invitation 2](https://classroom.github.com/a/XJCJHGxY) | 30         |
|  3| Test with Actions      | [Invitation 3](https://classroom.github.com/a/K3KeJKtM) | 25         |
|  4| Publish Packages       | [Invitation 4](https://classroom.github.com/a/9PfDS4T2) | 20         |

## Grading

For each task, full points will be awarded only for complete tasks. Zero points will be given for partial completion or no attempt.

## Submission

After completing all tasks, you must submit the URLs for the GitHub repositories containing your completed work. Submit these URLs through the **Canvas Assignment** provided for this lab.

:::{important}
All GitHub repositories must reside in the UC3093C GitHub organization, as created by the GitHub Classroom link. Do not create repositories manually.
