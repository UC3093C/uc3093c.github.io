# Lab 3: Focus on Quality

```{warning}

```

In this lab assigment, students will identify and analyze three real-world scenarios where software quality failures have led to significant consequences such as financial losses, loss of life, or damage to equipment. They will investigate the root causes of these failures, the specific impacts, and what measures were or could have been implemented to prevent them. By examining these scenarios, students will develop a deeper understanding of the importance of integrating quality considerations into every layer of the software engineering process, with a particular emphasis on the foundational "Focus on Quality" layer.

## Background

```{warning}
This lab is not yet complete, do not start it until a Canvas announcement is made.
```

**Software Engineering as a Layered Technology**, developed by IEEE, illustrates how different aspects of software engineering build upon one another to form a cohesive framework.

The **Focus on Quality** layer is critical because it serves as the bedrock for the entire software engineering framework. Quality is not merely a phase but a mindset and practice that must permeate every layer of development. Without a strong emphasis on quality, tools may fail to address defects, methods may produce inadequate designs, and processes may result in unreliable systems. A focus on quality ensures that each layer works harmoniously to deliver robust, reliable, and efficient software that meets user needs and withstands real-world demands.

Without a robust focus on quality, the entire structure becomes unstable, leading to potential failures with significant consequences. This lab will help you explore how lapses in software quality have had real-world impacts.

### Part 1: Reseach and Analyze Real-World Scenarios

You will identify and analyze three real-world scenarios where software quality failures have led to significant consequences. For each scenario, you will provide the following details:

1. Overview
   - A brief summary of the situation.
   - The software or system involved.

2. Impact
   - Specific consequences (e.g., monetary loss, fatalities, damaged equipment).
   - Cause: The software quality issue that caused the failure (e.g., poor testing, overlooked edge cases, inadequate requirements).

3. Preventative Measures:
   - What was done to prevent this failure from occuring again?
   - What could have been done to prevent the failure?

### Part 2: "Software Engineering as a Layered Technology"

For each scenario, consider how the "Focus on Quality" layer of software engineering could have mitigated or prevented the failure. Address the following questions:

- what layer of software engineering had a breakdown that resulted in a quality failure?
- What specific practices, methodologies, or tools could have reinforced the focus on quality in the scenario?
- How does this emphasize the importance of integrating quality considerations at every stage of development?
