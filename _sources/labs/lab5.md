# Lab 5: Security

Today's open source software ecosystem is a complex web of interdependencies. This complexity can lead to security vulnerabilities, as software components may have hidden dependencies on other components that are not immediately visible. In this lab, we will explore the security implications of open source software and how you might mitigate these risks.
