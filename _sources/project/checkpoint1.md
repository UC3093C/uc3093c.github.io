# Checkpoint 1: Project Selection (25% of Project Grade)

Your first task is to select an open-source project that will serve as the focus of your semester-long analysis. The project must have a significant user base and active development community. This requirement ensures there will be sufficient material and history for a comprehensive analysis of software engineering practices.

## Project Requirements

- Must be a widely-used open-source project with substantial user adoption (e.g, **5,000+ users**)
- Should have an active development community
- You must be able to contribute to the project
- Must have a public GitHub repository with accessible documentation and history

## Recommended Resources for Project Selection

- Review GitHub's Annual Octoverse Report (https://octoverse.github.com/) which highlights the most popular and active open-source projects
  - [Octoverse 2024](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/)
  - [Octoverse 2023](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/)
- Some examples of qualifying projects include:
  - Programming Languages: Python, Rust, Go
  - Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, Git
  - Scientific Computing: NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow
  - Operating Systems: Linux Kernel, Zephyr RTOS
  - Applications: Home Assistant, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Docker

## Deliverables

For this checkpoint, submit a document that:

1. Identifies your chosen project
2. Brief explanation (1-2 paragraphs) of why you chose this project
3. Includes links to the project's Main repository
4. Provides evidence of its widespread adoption 
   - User base size and growth metrics
   - GitHub stars and fork trends
   - Usage in other projects (dependencies)
   - Industry adoption examples
   - Community size indicators (Discord, Slack, forums, etc.)
5. Provide project activity metrics
   - Number of active contributors in the last 6 months
   - Frequency of releases (release cadence)
   - Commit frequency and patterns
   - Issue closure rates
   - Pull request statistics (acceptance rate, time to merge)
   - Code velocity metrics (lines changed, files modified per period)
6. Core Benefit Analysis (2-3 paragraphs): For this deliverable, provide a thorough analysis of your chosen project's fundamental value proposition and its distinctive contribution to the software ecosystem. Your analysis should explore:
   1. The core problem or need this software addresses
      - What fundamental challenge or limitation does it solve?
      - Why is this problem significant enough to warrant an open-source solution?
      - How does the open-source nature of the project enable it to solve this problem differently than commercial alternatives?
   2. The project's unique value proposition
      - What capabilities or approaches set it apart from similar solutions (both open-source and commercial)?
      - How does being open-source specifically enhance its ability to serve its users?
      - What advantages does the community-driven development model provide for this particular software?
      
    For example, Linux succeeded not just because it provided an operating system, but because its open-source nature enabled widespread adoption, customization, and innovation across diverse hardware platforms in ways that proprietary systems couldn't match. Home Assistant thrives because its open architecture allows integration with virtually any smart home device, preventing vendor lock-in and enabling customization that commercial solutions typically restrict.
