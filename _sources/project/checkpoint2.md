# Checkpoint 2: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Analysis
**(35% of Project Grade)**

Building on your project selection and initial analysis from Checkpoint 1, this checkpoint focuses on examining your chosen open-source project’s development processes. By analyzing its Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practices, you will gain a deeper understanding of how the project transitions from initial ideas to released and maintained software. This checkpoint will help you recognize the project’s engineering maturity, quality control measures, and collaboration patterns—essential insights for contributing effectively to open-source communities.

In this checkpoint, you will create a concise, well-organized report (approximately 2–3 pages, **excluding images**) that details your inferred understanding of the project’s SDLC practices. Back up your inferences with **specific evidence**, including **direct links** to repository items and/or **screenshots** of relevant discussions, processes, or artifacts.

**Key Focus Areas:**
1. **SDLC Model or Practices Inferred**
2. **Justification with Specific Evidence (Links/Screenshots)**
3. **Analysis of SDLC Strengths and Weaknesses**
4. **Reflection and Summary Linking to Software Engineering Principles**
5. **Implications for Your Future Contributions**

## Deliverables

1. Infer the SDLC Model or Practices: Determine which SDLC approach your project most closely resembles (e.g., Agile-like iteration, Waterfall, or a hybrid), even if not explicitly stated.  Some key questions to consider:
     - How are **requirements** or **feature requests** initiated (issue trackers, mailing lists, forums)?  
     - Is there a clear **design and planning** phase (design documents, architecture diagrams, PR discussions)?  
     - What **implementation and coding standards** exist (style guides, code reviews, linters, automated checks)?  
     - How is **testing and quality assurance** handled (unit/integration tests, CI pipelines, bug trackers)?  
     - What does **release management** look like (versioning strategy, release notes, release frequency)?  
     - How is **maintenance and support** organized (bug triage, security patches, LTS branches)?

2. Justify Your SDLC Inference: Provide concrete evidence to support your claims. Evidence requirements include:
    - Direct links to issues, pull requests, commits, or documentation.  
    - Screenshots of relevant interactions, code review comments, or release notes.

3. Analyze Strengths and Weaknesses: Critically assess how well the inferred SDLC model supports the project’s quality, collaboration, and sustainability. Some key areas to consider:
    - Agility & Responsiveness: Speed of adapting to new requests/bugs.  
    - Collaboration & Communication: Effectiveness of community interaction.  
    - Quality & Reliability: Thoroughness of testing and reviews.  
    - Scalability & Sustainability: Long-term viability and growth potential.

4. Reflection and Summary: Relate your findings to the fundamental layers of software engineering (process, methods, tools, quality focus).  For example, if the project heavily relies on CI tools, discuss how this ties into the “tools” layer and fosters quality assurance.
    1. Implications for Potential Contributions: Highlight key takeaways for future involvement. Some key questions to consider: 
        - Which processes must you follow to propose new features or fixes?  
        - Are there established testing/coding protocols to adhere to?  
        - How might you effectively communicate with maintainers and contributors?
