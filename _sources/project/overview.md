# Project Overview

In this course project, you will conduct an in-depth analysis of an open-source software project, examining how it embodies key principles and practices of software engineering. Through systematic investigation of the project's technical architecture, development processes, tooling decisions, and quality assurance approaches, you will gain practical insights into how real-world software projects implement the four fundamental layers of software engineering technology as defined by IEEE: process, methods, tools, and quality focus.

Your analysis will explore how your chosen project approaches critical aspects of software development - from its high-level architectural decisions and development methodologies to its specific technical implementations and quality control measures. This examination will help you understand how theoretical software engineering concepts manifest in practice within successful open-source projects.

```{admonition} An Opportunity...
:class: tip
Consider this project as an opportunity to stand out in technical interviews, especially with high-profile companies.  Become a member of the open-source community and contribute to the project you choose.  This project is an opportunity to demonstrate your skills and stand out in the job market.

## Project Structure and Grading

The project is structured as a series of checkpoints throughout the semester. Each checkpoint will focus on specific aspects of your analysis and build upon previous work. Your final project grade will be calculated as the sum of your checkpoint grades, with each checkpoint contributing a specific percentage to your overall project score. This incremental approach allows for regular feedback and guidance as you develop your analysis.
