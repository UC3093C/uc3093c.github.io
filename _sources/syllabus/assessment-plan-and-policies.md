## Exams

Exams are designed to assess your understanding of the course material. The exams are closed-book and closed-notes.

**Illness or Family Emergency During the Exam Period**

An examination may be rescheduled in the event of an emergency, or if it has become impossible or impracticable for you to take the exam at the scheduled time. If this is the case, then your deferral must be approved in advance by your academic department.  If you claim to be unable to take an exam because of your own illness or family memberâ€™s medical emergency, you must produce a valid statement from a physician.

Deferred exams will be administered at the assigned final exam time slot for the semester. 

**Unexcused Exam or Poor Exam Performance**

An optional comprehensive exam will be administered at the assigned final exam time slot for the semester.   You may take it to replace your lowest grade from Exams 1-4, including any unexcused missed exam for which you received a score of zero.
